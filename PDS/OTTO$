 The member called OTTO# contains an implementation of AUTO that is
 actually used somewhere.  Multiple systems each run a copy of OTTO.

 These files have been included to:

 1 - Help you set up a proc over multiple systems.

 2 - Show you how to take advantage of dynamic allocation of libraries.

 Best of luck.
